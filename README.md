# Free Code Camp
This repo contains my work on the tasks from Free Code Camp (http://freecodecamp.com).

Free Code Camp is an excellent way to learn new, or develop existing web development skills. I am in no way affiliated with Free Code Camp, but I do think it's awesome.

More involved projects will have their own repos - this repo will likely be exclusive to single-file projects, such as the algorithm writing tasks.
